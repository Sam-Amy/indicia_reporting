- find submissions to e.g. the vasuclar plant form  with zero abundance records
--re: https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/iRecord/issues/1172

-- first find title of vascular plant survey form
select distinct(s.title), s.id
from surveys s
where title like '%Vascular%'; -- id = 325


select sample_id, count(cof.id) as count_observations from cache_occurrences_functional cof 
where cof.survey_id = '325'
and cof.zero_abundance = TRUE
group by cof.sample_id 

select sample_id, count(cof.id) as count_observations from cache_occurrences_functional cof 
where cof.survey_id = '325'
and cof.sample_id in ('3175386','25122580')
group by cof.sample_id

-- There have been only two samples submitted via this form with observations where zero abundance = true; sample_id 3,175,386 (3 observations of four) and 25,122,580 (1 observation of 1)
